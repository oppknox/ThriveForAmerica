A Vision for America's Revival: A Modern Manifesto

‚ú® Foundational Values

Free Speech: Absolute protection of speech in public institutions. No compelled ideology in education or government.

Meritocracy: Reinstate achievement-based systems in education, hiring, and promotion. End the obsession with identity over capability.

Limited Government: Reduce the scope of federal intervention. More power to states and individuals.

üí∞ Economic Freedom

1. Abolish Income Tax

Eliminate federal income and capital gains taxes.

Replace with a national consumption-based tax.

2. Tiered National Sales Tax

Implement a high base national sales tax.

End-of-year rebates based on W2 and capital gains income to make the system progressive in effect.

Exempt necessities like groceries and medicine.

3. AI and Robot Taxation

Tax AI usage with a low, almost invisible usage fee that compounds into significant national revenue.

Register all physical robots like employees.

No carveouts for startups or small businesses.

4. End Subsidized Dependency

End subsidies across all classes: oil, corn, electric vehicles.

Subsidies should only exist short-term to drive innovation, then expire.

‚ú® Cultural Reform

1. End Wokeism and Victim Hierarchies

Dismantle DEI bureaucracies.

Eliminate race-based policies.

No more Oppression Olympics.

2. Restore National Pride

Be honest about challenges in all communities, including minority ones.

3. Push Back on Radical Gender Ideology

No gender theory in public K-12 education.

Parental consent required for all gender-related interventions for minors.

4. Public vs. Private Protections

Public institutions must protect free expression.

Private employers are free to set speech standards.

Political discrimination protections left to individual states.

üè´ Education Overhaul

1. School Choice

Fund students, not systems. Allow public funds to follow students to charter, private, or homeschool.

2. Refocus Higher Education

Slash funding for non-STEM fields with poor ROI.

Require colleges to co-sign on student loans.

Encourage vocational and trade education.

üåç Immigration

Punish businesses that exploit illegal labor.

üåü Strong National Defense

üè° Family First

1. Family Incentives

Expand child tax credits for married couples and employed single parents.

No support for those exploiting childbirth for income.

2. Long-Term Child Care Subsidies

Maintain subsidies that help working families afford quality childcare.

Ensure the next generation thrives in stable homes.

3. National Response to Low Fertility

Recognize that the U.S. replacement rate (1.6) is unsustainable.

Model policies after nations like Hungary and Singapore.

üí™ The Big Picture

America must return to its core: personal responsibility, family, innovation, and freedom. This is not about left or right, it's about rising from decline, ending the culture of dependence, and choosing excellence over excuses.

We don‚Äôt need more bureaucracy or performative politics. We need results.

This is the way forward.
